CHANGELOG
=========

2.8.0
-----

 * Deprecated usage of a colon in an unquoted mapping value
 * Deprecated usage of @, \`, | and > at the beginning of an unquoted string
 * When surrounding strings with double-quotes, you must now escape `\` characters. Not
   escaping those characters (when surrounded by double-quotes) is deprecated.

   Before:

   ```yml
   class: "Foo\Var"
   ```

   After:

   ```yml
   class: "Foo\\Var"
   ```

2.1.0
-----

 * Yaml::parse() does not evaluate loaded files as PHP files by default
   anymore (call Yaml::enablePhpParsing() to get back the old behavior)
